"Sousastep Audio FX" is a Max project for audio effects manipulated by a game controller that's attached to a tuba. It mostly uses Eventide, Arturia, and NeuralDSP plugins, but it also includes a custom LFO and dubstep effect, implemented mostly in gen\~, that relies on Surreal Machine's ladder filter emulation.

"Sousastep Visual FX" is a Max project for generating visual effects and transmitting them to an [LED sousaphone bell](https://jbaylies.github.io/Electrobrass_Encyclopedia/en/master/content/tutorials/LED-sousa-bell.html) via OctoWS2811. This project relies on LFO and envelope data from "Sousastep XII".

"Sousastep Live Project" is an Ableton Live project that can provide tempo to Max via a phasor in a Max for Live device. It incorporates [JamTaba](https://github.com/elieserdejesus/JamTaba) for live jamming, and also provides backing tracks and tuba stems, which are not stored in this repo. 

"Hardware Configs" backs up routings from the RME MADIface Pro and the [Eventide H9000 Dante expansion card](https://cdn.eventideaudio.com/manuals/h9000/2.0/content/expansions/dante.html). "H9000" backs up data from the Eventide H9000.

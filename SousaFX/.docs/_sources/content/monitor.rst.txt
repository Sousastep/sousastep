Monitor Mix
===========

Monitor mixes are different from "front of house" mixes 
in that they focus on the performing musician's ears 
instead of the audience's. SousaFX's monitor mix 
EQs the "front of house" mix and adds the metronome. 
The metronome can also be sent to its own audio output 
in the :ref:`Audio I/O Status <Audio IO Status>` window.

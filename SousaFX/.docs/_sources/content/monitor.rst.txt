Monitor Mix
===========

Monitor mixes differ from "front of house" mixes 
in that they focus on the performing musician's ears 
instead of the audience's. By default, the loopers 
are quieter in the monitor mix than the FoH mix, 
and the solo and delay FX are louder in the 
monitor mix than the FoH mix. The monitor mix also 
includes a :ref:`metronome <Metronome>`, while the FoH mix does not.

.. note::

   The metronome can also be sent to its own external audio output 
   in the :ref:`Audio I/O Status <Audio IO Status>` window.

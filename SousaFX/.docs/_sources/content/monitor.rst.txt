Monitor & Front of House Mix
============================

This window lets you set the levels for the Monitor mix and the Front of House mix.

The monitor mix includes a :ref:`metronome <Metronome>` click, and a :ref:`looper <Loopers>` alert.

Generally, for the monitor mix, the loopers should be a bit quieter, and the solos and delays should be louder.

The FoH mix then goes through a limiter, 
and the monitor mix goes through a limiter and an EQ, 
which can be accessed near the bottom of the :ref:`Main Window <Main Window>`.

   - The FoH mix's audio output channels can be set via the "Main L" and "Main R" Output Mappings.
   
   - The monitor mix's audio output channels can be set via the "Monitor L" and "Monitor R" Output Mappings
   
   - The metronome's audio output channel can be set via the "Metronome Click" Output Mapping.

Monitor mixes are different from "front of house" mixes in that they focus on the performing musician's ears instead of the audience's.

SousaFX's monitor mix consists of the "front of house" mix, with the tuba boosted while soloing over the looper, and a metronome.

:solo gain compensation:

   The boost skips the main reverb, comp, and limiter. 
   Set this dial to compensate for the difference in gain.

:solo boost:

   While soloing, boost the volume of the solo in the monitor mix.

:playback bus:

   MIDI mapped to Ableton Live's "playack bus" track's monitor mix volume send.

:metronome:

   Volume of metronome into monitor mix. 
   The metronome can also be sent to its own 
   audio output in the :ref:`Audio I/O Status <Audio IO Status>` window.

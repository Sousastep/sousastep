Recommendations
---------------

Any m-series mac is recommended.

If you haven't optimized your computer for audio performance yet, `these Ableton articles are worth checking out <https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=optimize>`_.

The `RME Babyface Pro <https://www.rme-audio.de/downloads/bface_pro_fs_e.pdf>`_ is an end-game audio interface, but any interface with a mic input, main output, and monitor output will do, such as the `Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen <https://fael-downloads-prod.focusrite.com/customer/prod/downloads/scarlett_solo_studio_4th_gen_user_guide_v3-pdf-en.pdf>`_. The more `loopback <https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/loopback-explained-what-is-audio-loopback/>`_ channels, the better, though, because SousaFX and SousaPlayback can make good use of them. 

If you're performing live you may also want to invest in a DI such as the `TrimTwo <https://www.radialeng.com/product/trim-two>`_ or `MixingLink <https://www.eventideaudio.com/pedals/mixinglink/>`_, which will prevent the venue's mixing board from accidentally sending phantom power into your cherished interface.

`In ear monitors <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs>`_ are vastly preferrable to headphones or speakers for being able to hear yourself while performing live.

SousaFX is developed and tested with a PS4 controller, and an Xbox Elite 2 controller. If I had to recommend one of them then it'd be the Xbox controller. However, `all gamepads listed here are supported <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/src/joystick/SDL_gamecontrollerdb.h>`_.

If you're using a `SilentBrass mute <https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/winds/silent_brass/silent_brass_sbj_series/index.html>`_ you'll need an `eighth inch TRS to dual quarter inch TS cable <https://www.sweetwater.com/store/search?s=3.5mm+trs+to+dual+1%2F4+ts>`_ to properly connect the PersonalStudio's headphone output to the audio interface's line inputs.

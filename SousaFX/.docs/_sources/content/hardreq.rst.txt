Hardware
========

Requirements
------------

1. m-series mac:

   Any m-series mac is recommended. The min-spec m4 mac mini is a beast and only costs $530 with an edu discount. SousaFX is currently untested on Windows.

   .. note:: To optimize your mac for audio performance, `check out these articles <https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=optimize>`_.

|

2. audio interface:

   The `RME Babyface Pro <https://www.rme-usa.com/babyface-pro.html>`_ is highly recommended.

   The `Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 4th Gen <https://us.focusrite.com/products/scarlett-4i4>`_ is decent.

   You may also want to invest in a DI such as the `TrimTwo <https://www.radialeng.com/product/trim-two>`_ or `MixingLink <https://www.eventideaudio.com/pedals/mixinglink/>`_ to prevent venues' mixing boards from accidentally sending phantom power into your interface.

|

3. headphones, in-ear monitors, or loudspeaker:

   `In ear monitors <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs>`_ are vastly preferrable to headphones or speakers for being able to hear yourself while performing live.

|

4. XLR microphone, or Yamaha SilentBrass™ mute & PersonalStudio™:

   I use the Audio-Technica Pro35 clip-on mic.
   
   If you're using a `SilentBrass mute <https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/winds/silent_brass/silent_brass_sbj_series/index.html>`_ you'll need an `eighth inch TRS to dual quarter inch TS cable <https://www.sweetwater.com/store/search?s=3.5mm+trs+to+dual+1%2F4+ts>`_ to connect the PersonalStudio's headphone output to the audio interface's line inputs.

|

5. tuba:

   A `LED sousaphone bell <https://edu.sousastep.quest/content/tutorials/LED-sousa-bell.html>`_ is optional.

|

6. wireless game controller:

   SousaFX is developed and tested with a PS4 controller, and an Xbox Elite 2 controller. The Xbox's layout is more ergonomic than Playstation, and the Playstation's buttons are more responsive than Xbox. 

   `All gamepads listed here are supported <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/src/joystick/SDL_gamecontrollerdb.h>`_.

|

7. velcro straps to attach the controller to the tuba:

   I used to use `lettuce wraps <http://www.ashbeedesign.com/2013/01/recycle-lettuce-wrap-for-cord-control.html>`_, now I use `monoprice's cable ties <https://www.monoprice.com/search/index?keyword=velcro>`_.

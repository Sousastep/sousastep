Main Envelope
=============

The main envelope affects five effects:

1. :ref:`Crossfade <Envelope Crossfade>`

2. :ref:`Noise Gate <Envelope Crossfade>`

3. :ref:`Mod Params <Modulation Parameters>`

4. :ref:`Transient Detector <Modulation Parameters>`

5. :ref:`VFX Envelopes <SousaVFX>`

While playing softly in a home studio, turn up the main envelope sensitivity. Before blasting on a live stage, turn down the main envelope sensitivity. 

The further the mic is in the bell, the lower the main envelope sensitivity will need to be.

Parameters
----------

- Main

   Envelope sensitivity.

- Freq

   The frequency to boost.

- Boost

   The amount in dB to boost the selected frequency.

   Boosting between 1 kHz - 4 kHz makes the envelope respond to the brightness of the tuba's sound. It's a simple way to apply `frequency weighting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting>`_ that makes the envelope a bit snappier.

- Q

   The "quality" / resonance of the boost.

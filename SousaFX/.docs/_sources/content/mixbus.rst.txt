Mix Bus
=======

The Mix Bus contains two separate compressors for the :ref:`High's <Crossover>` Attack and Sustain signal paths, which are post-:ref:`crossfade <Envelope Crossfade>`.

The compressors for the Octaver and the :ref:`Lows <Crossover>` are separate from the Mix Bus and can be opened by clicking the orange circles on the bottom right.

The volume faders adjust the volume of the Attack and Sustain's High, Low, and Octaver signal paths.

The mutes can be automated from :ref:`SousaPlayback <Main Track List>`, but I don't really use that anymore.

Mix Bus
=======

The Mix Bus contains two separate compressors for the :ref:`High's <Crossover>` Attack and Sustain signal paths, which are post-:ref:`crossfade <Envelope Crossfade>`.

The compressors for the Octaver and the :ref:`Lows <Crossover>` are separate from the Mix Bus and can be opened by clicking the orange circles on the bottom left.

The toggle in the bottom-middle allows the Octaver to automatically be muted while the :ref:`looper <Loopers>`'s looping / fading.

The High, Low, and Octaver volume dials lower the volume of the Attack signal paths to help them match the volume of the Sustain signal paths.

The High, Low, and Octaver volume faders adjust the volume of the Attack and Sustain signal paths simultaneously.

The mutes and volumes can be automated from :ref:`SousaPlayback <Main Track List>`, which is displayed by the sliders to the left of the faders.

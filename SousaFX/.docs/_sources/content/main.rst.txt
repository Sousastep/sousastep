.. important:: Closing this window quits SousaFX. Click the sunset icon on the bottom-right to quit more gracefully. SousaFX auto-saves some settings on shutdown.

Main Presets
------------

On the top-right are the main presets, which save the current state of the :ref:`modulation parameters <Modulation Parameters>`, the :ref:`FX Banks' <FX Banks>` slot selections, bleed amount, and pitch amount. The main preset selection is accessible via "preset 1 - 4" in the :ref:`bindings <Controller Bindings>`. The button to the right of the preset number sets the initial preset number to load on startup.  The hidden button below "Main" displays all saved preset parameter values

.. important:: Switching from one preset to another without saving will lose changes. Switching from one preset to a blank slot allows you to save the previous preset into the blank slot.

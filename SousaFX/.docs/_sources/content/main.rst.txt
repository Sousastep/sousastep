Main Window
===========

This window outlines SousaFX's audio signal flow, and links to the :ref:`audio effects <Audio Effects>`, :ref:`controller bindings <Controller Bindings>`, and :ref:`settings <Settings>`.

.. important:: Closing this window quits SousaFX. Click the sunset icon on the bottom-right to quit more gracefully. SousaFX auto-saves some settings on shutdown.

Main Presets
------------

On the top-right are the main presets, which save the current state of the :ref:`modulation parameters <Modulation Parameters>`, and the :ref:`FX Banks' <FX Banks>` slot selections, bleed amount, and pitch amount. The main preset selection is accessible via "preset 1 - 4" in the :ref:`bindings <Controller Bindings>`. The button to the right of the preset number sets the initial preset number to load on startup.

.. important:: Switching from one preset to another without saving will lose changes. Switching from one preset to a blank slot allows you to save the previous preset into the blank slot.

Version
-------

Clicking the version number underneath the SousaFX logo opens the :ref:`About window <Prestige System>`. The version number will be highlighted if there's an :ref:`update <Updating>` available.

Power
-----

The power button next to the left of the Octaver is the audio engine's on/off button. Turning off the audio engine saves CPU while SousaFX is not in use.

Background Color
----------------

The :ref:`Color Select icon <Background Color>` above the power button sets the Main Window's background color.

Peak Meters
-----------

Many FX sport a peak meter that shows how loud the FX's output has gotten. Clicking the peak meter resets it. Pressing the backslash key resets all the peak meters.

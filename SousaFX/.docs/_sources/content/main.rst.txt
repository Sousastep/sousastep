Main Window
===========

This window links to all of SousaFX's :ref:`audio effect parameters <Audio Effects>`, :ref:`controller bindings <Controller Bindings>`, and :ref:`various settings <Settings>`.

On the top-left is the audio engine's on/off button, next to the CPU meter. Below that is SousaFX's version number, which will brighten if there's an :ref:`update <Updating>` available.

On the top-right are the main presets, which save the preset description, :ref:`modulation parameters <Modulation Parameters>`, and the :ref:`FX Bank's <FX Banks>` slot selections and bleed amount. The main presets can be selected using the :ref:`game controller <Controller Bindings>`.

The controller bindings window uses `max's crosspatch <https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/crosspatch object>`_ to connect gamepad inputs with effect parameters.

To create a binding, click one circle and drag the connection to a circle on the other side of crosspatch. To delete a binding, click the connection and press the delete key. To save bindings, click "save / overwrite".

The bindings are mapped to be ergonomic for having the controller on the side of a tuba. The right bumper, right trigger, and left trigger all change which bindings the X A B Y buttons are assigned to. The left trigger also changes the dpad and LB's bindings, to allow for a second bank of subdivisions.

Click the parameter labels to open their :ref:`control logic settings <Parameter Control Logic>`.

Click to the right of the parameter labels to open the parameters window that they apply to.

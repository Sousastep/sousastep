Audio Effects
=============

SousaFX has a number of custom effects such as a dubstep-style lowpass filter, an envelope crossfade that allows loud sounds to be effected differently than soft sounds, a stutter with acceleration, a tremolo with adjustable duty cycle, a one-button looper, dub-style delay sends, and volume automation tied to the kick drum.

Many effects are from the `rnbo guitar pedals package <https://rnbo.cycling74.com/explore/rnbo-pedals>`_. These effects can be replaced with plugins if desired.

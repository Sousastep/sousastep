Latency Compensation
====================

Latency compensation is recalculated whenever a plugin loads, 
or an FX Bank selection changes. This provides the lowest possible latency depending on which effects are in use. If a plugin parameter changes its plugin's latency, you must manually trigger a recalculation by clicking the plugin selector's "check latency" button.

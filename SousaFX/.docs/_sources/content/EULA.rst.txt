------------------------

Sousastep does not warrant that the Software is error free.  Sousastep offers the Software **as is** and **with all faults** and by using the Software, you accept it **as is** and **with all faults**.

Should the Software prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

Because the Software is provided free of charge during the Trial Period to allow potential customers to evaluate and test it before paying the license fee, Sousastep enforces a strict no-refund policy.  Please evaluate and test the Software carefully during the Trial Period.  Once you pay the license fee, your payment is final and may not be reimbursed.

In any case, Sousastep's entire liability under the provisions of this EULA or the applicable law shall be limited to the amount paid by you for the Software.

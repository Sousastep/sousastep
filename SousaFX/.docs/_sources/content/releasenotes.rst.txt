Release Notes
=============

0.9.5
-----

Sousaâ€‹â€‹FX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refactor Post-crossfade FX's signal chain into :ref:`Solo FX <FX Banks>`. The main signal path auto-switches from Wobble FX to Solo FX when the :ref:`looper <Loopers>` finishes recording, and vice versa when looper finishes fading out.

- Add two bindable parameters to the :ref:`Modulation Parameters <Modulation Parameters>`: LFO Auto-Wah Pause, and LFO Env Pause.

- :ref:`Controller Bindings <Controller Bindings>`: Allow multiple imputs to bind to a single output.

- Refactor the :ref:`Mix Bus <Mix Bus>` and :ref:`Monitor Mix <Monitor Mix>` to make them less confusing.

- Add filter boost parameters to :ref:`Main Envelope <Main Envelope>` to allow frequency weighing.

- Scale the :ref:`Modulation Parameters' <Modulation Parameters>` envelope so that it begins at the bottom of the :ref:`Envelope Crossfade's <Envelope Crossfade>` gate.

- Add limiter parameter to the :ref:`delay's <Delay and Reverb Sends>` feedback loop.

- Allow :ref:`stutter's <Main Stutter Tremolo & Filters>` startpoint to be modulated via the "staircase" parameter.

- Add :ref:`peak meters <Peak Meters>` to main window.

- Remove :ref:`Looper's <Loopers>` option to auto-play next scene in Ableton once looper finishes fading out. Instead, trigger a random drum clip based on the current tempo.

- Fix :ref:`Parameter Control Logic <Parameter Control Logic>` bug where some instances were referring to incorrect bindings.

- Add options for :ref:`Parameter Control Logic <Parameter Control Logic>` to utilize RB, RT, and LT instead of "is tuba playing".

- Remove :ref:`Parameter Control Logic <Parameter Control Logic>`'s cool background because it was using lots of RAM.

Known Bugs
----------

- the :ref:`About SousaFX <Prestige System>` window shows "0 0" as install date on first boot.

- if you :ref:`reinstantiate an effect <Selectable Effects>` after saving its first user preset without rebooting SousaFX, the effect will reload its default preset.

- if an :ref:`FX Bank <FX Banks>` is set to "bypass when looper's inactive", it must be manually unbypassed before saving a main preset.

- plugin selectors can only clear plugin slot by manually deleting json file in data folder.

- :ref:`Param Control Logic's <Parameter Control Logic>` "This control is mapped to the joystick" message won't update when switching presets. It will update when manually adding and removing connections.

Parameter Control Logic
=======================

Bindings can be relinquished and established 
automatically based on wether or not the tuba's playing. 
This can happen either immediately 
when the tuba starts or stops playing, or it can wait 
until the gamepad's respective joystick axis 
touches its :ref:`deadzone or default value <Deadzones>`.

The aformentioned settings can be chosen per each of the four main :ref:`looper states <Loopers>`.

- idle, prepared: Playing bassline

- recording: Recording bassline

- looping: Looping bassline while soloing.

- fading out: Fading out bassline while soloing.

The control can be inverted, and curved as well. The "uni/bi" menu allows the curve to be unipolar or bipolar.

These settings are saved within the :ref:`controller bindings <Controller Bindings>` presets.

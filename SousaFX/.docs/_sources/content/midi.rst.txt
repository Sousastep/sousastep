MIDI Preferences
================

These are set correctly by default, and correspond to :ref:`SousaPlayback's MIDI mappings <sousaPlaybackMIDI>`.

If you're using an `RME <https://www.rme-usa.com/>`_ audio interface, then the toggle near the bottom right can auto-trigger the first Snapshot in TotalMix when SousaFX loads. Ensure that the MIDI port is the same as the one selected in TotalMix > menubar > Options > Settings... > MIDI > MIDI Connections > Input Port, and under Mackie Control Options check Enable Protocol Support.
